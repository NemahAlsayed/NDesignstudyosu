In a world obsessed with filters and curated realities, the mirror remains one of the few objects that refuses to lie. Inspired by Sylvia Plath’s piercing poem _Mirror_, our latest NFT artwork captures the raw essence of truth—unbiased, unfiltered, and unflinching.

### 🔍 What Is the "Mirror" NFT?

This NFT is a visual meditation on Plath’s lines:

> “I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions. Whatever I see I swallow immediately Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.”

The artwork fuses digital minimalism with symbolic geometry, portraying the mirror not as a passive object, but as an active witness—a “little god, four-cornered.” It challenges viewers to confront their own reflections, stripped of illusion.

### 🌐 Why This NFT Resonates in the Digital Age

In the age of blockchain and AI, the concept of a mirror takes on new meaning. Just as Plath’s mirror swallows reality without bias, so too does the blockchain record truth without distortion. This NFT invites collectors to own a piece of digital philosophy—an eternal reflection encoded on the blockchain.

### 🧠 Philosophical Themes Behind the Art

- **Truth vs. Perception**: The mirror doesn’t interpret—it reflects. This NFT asks: Can we handle truth without narrative?

- **Identity and Ego**: What do we see when we look at ourselves without emotional fog?

- **Divine Witnessing**: The “eye of a little god” suggests omniscient observation. In a decentralized world, who watches whom?
