### ✨ Introduction: Where Poetry Meets the Blockchain

In a world increasingly digitized, the soul still seeks meaning. That’s why I created an NFT artwork inspired by one of the most hauntingly beautiful poems by Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi: _At The Twilight_. This piece is more than just a token—it’s a portal into the metaphysical, a visual meditation on the soul’s journey beyond the self.

Whether you're a collector of spiritual NFTs, a lover of Rumi’s timeless wisdom, or simply exploring art that speaks to the heart, this creation invites you to pause, reflect, and connect.

### 🖼️ The Poem That Inspired the NFT

> “At the twilight, a moon appeared in the sky; Then it landed on earth to look at me…”

Rumi’s verses evoke a celestial encounter—where the moon becomes a divine mirror, stealing the self and dissolving it into soul. This NFT captures that moment of surrender, where ego fades and essence emerges.

### 🔍 Why This NFT Is Unique

- **Spiritual Depth:** Rooted in Rumi’s Sufi philosophy, this artwork channels themes of transcendence, unity, and divine love.

- **Visual Storytelling:** The NFT blends twilight hues, lunar symbolism, and abstract soul forms to create a meditative experience.

- **Blockchain Legacy:** Minted on Rarible, this piece offers collectors a chance to own a fragment of poetic eternity.
