This art symbolizes the rich wisdoms of Mavlana Jalal El-din Al-Rumi in a Mystic Sufi Poem as the following:

A New Rule  
It is the rule with drunkards to fall upon each other,  
to quarrel, become violent, and make a scene.  
The lover is even worse than a drunkard.  
I will tell you what love is: to enter a mine of gold.  
And what is that gold?  
The lover is a king above all kings,  
unafraid of death, not at all interested in a golden crown.  
The dervish has a pearl concealed under his patched cloak.  
Why should he go begging door to door?  
Last night that moon came along,  
drunk, dropping clothes in the street.  
"Get up," I told my heart, "Give the soul a glass of wine.  
The moment has come to join the nightingale in the garden,  
to taste sugar with the soul-parrot."  
I have fallen, with my heart shattered - 
where else but on your path? And I  
broke your bowl, drunk, my idol, so drunk,  
don't let me be harmed, take my hand.  
A new rule a new law has been born:  
break all the glasses and fall toward the glassblower.  
**Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi**
