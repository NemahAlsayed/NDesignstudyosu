In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. We begin today's article with a journey through the charming alleys of Istanbul. During the holy month of Ramadan, you can visit many historical sites on a tour before iftar time and then find the right place to break your fast.

I began my tour by visiting the historic Isbank Museum, which was founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic:

These artistic masterpieces are evidence that the Ottoman language was still in use in 1924.

We continue our tour at the Museum of Art and Civilization, where the highest professional techniques in engineering, design, and banking are combined:

Then I continued my tour to the Hagia Sophia Museum and took many wonderful pictures that testify to the Ottoman craftsmanship in calligraphy, poetry and art, such as this exhibition:

The golden inscription tells us about the castle built by Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror during the blessed month of Ramadan in Constantinople. The last line of the plaque reads, "Exactly 83 AH."

We will quote the verses from another plaque, along with a translation of their meanings:

Hurşid Şevket Şehriyar'ın değiştirilmiş şiirinin başlangıcı

Bani Baniyan Devlet, Kutsal Ev'in hizmetkarı

Milal Sirtah'ın krallığının varisi olan iki genç adam

Azal Dadar İskender Gulam'ın gölgesi süslenmeye devam etti

Dön, Sultan Mustafa sana ihanet etti

Tajdaran Salfadeh Kormade sanki uyuyormuşum gibi

Eliop, Shilshanem'in parasını bozdurdu

Aksa Maram'da yeni bir ev inşa edeceğim

"Bu Diwan Samayoun" cümlesi için özür imzalandı

Seramngeh Shaqfna Yuanen ve Jajah Benam

Sultans Selef Asf Nakah'a gideceğim

Kazınmış düğmenin çiziminin izlerini tamamen silin

İki genç adam birbirini öptü ve dünya onlara bir erkek gibi baktı

Ben Şayan'ım, yemin ederim ki sen ilk iffetli olansın.

Çatınızı yıkan bir rahibin kanında eriyen bir şey

Eski tarz stiller tamamen yenileniyor.

* * *

The beginning of the modified poem by Khurshid Shaukat Shahriar

I am the builder of the states buidings, servant of the Sacred House

Two young men who were heirs to the kingdom of Milal Sirtah

Azal Dadar Iskander Ghulam's shadow continued to adorn

Return, Sultan Mustafa betrayed you

Tajdaran Salfadeh Kormade as if I were sleeping

Eliop cashed out Shilshanem's money

I will build a new house in the most far wish

Apology signed for the phrase "This Diwan Samayoun"

Seramngeh Shaqfna Yuanen and Jajah Benam

I will go to Sultans Salaf Asf Nakah

Erase completely the traces of the drawing of the engraved button

Two young men kissed each other and the world looked at them like a man

I am Shayan, I swear that you are the first chaste one.

Something that melts in the blood of a priest who tore down your roof

Old-fashioned styles are being completely revamped.
