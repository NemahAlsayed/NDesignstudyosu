In a world increasingly shaped by pixels and blockchain, I wanted to create something that transcends the digital — something that speaks to the soul. That’s how my latest NFT artwork was born: a visual meditation on Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi’s poem _“Any Lifetime.”_

### 🧠 The Poem That Sparked a Vision

> _“Any lifetime that is spent without seeing the master_ _Is either death in disguise or a deep sleep._ _The water that pollutes you is poison;_ _The poison that purifies you is water.”_

These lines are more than poetry — they’re a spiritual cipher. Rumi’s paradoxes challenge our perception of reality, urging us to look beyond appearances and awaken to deeper truths. The “master” here isn’t just a person; it’s the divine presence, the guiding light, the inner compass we often ignore.

### 🎨 Translating Rumi into Digital Canvas

My NFT piece captures this tension between illusion and awakening. I used layered textures to evoke the duality of sleep and death — soft, dreamlike hues clashing with stark, shadowy forms. A central figure floats between two realms: one polluted by distraction, the other purified by surrender.

The water motif plays a key role. In the artwork, it flows in reverse — upward — symbolizing the reversal of worldly logic. Poison becomes water. Water becomes poison. It’s a visual echo of Rumi’s mystical inversion.

### 🌐 Why NFT?

Rumi’s words have traveled centuries, languages, and continents. By minting this artwork as an NFT, I’m extending that journey into the metaverse — preserving the essence of his message in a format that speaks to today’s seekers. It’s not just a collectible; it’s a digital shrine to awakening.

### 💭 Final Reflections

Creating this piece was a spiritual exercise. It reminded me that art — like poetry — can be a portal. A well-crafted NFT isn’t just a token; it’s a talisman. And if even one viewer pauses, reflects, and reconnects with their inner master, then this creation has served its purpose.
