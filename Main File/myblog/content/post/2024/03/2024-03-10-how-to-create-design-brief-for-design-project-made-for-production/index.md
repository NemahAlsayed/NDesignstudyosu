In today's post I will share with you how to create a design brief to participate in international competition held by an Italian university called Poli.Design; Save this post for future competition dates, specially if you are a design or industrial design student;

The challenge of this competition was to design **different types of chairs**, interpreting values and identity of Porada, and the guidelines that will inspire the partecipants will be **innovation, originality and search of new design solutions for woodworking**.

The design brief above is inspired by various wood items found in Instagram posts of Damascus; Thus creating this "mood" board.

Here is a Design of a chair incorporating turquoise leather, wood, and rose gold metal.
