That’s how my latest NFT artwork was born: a visual meditation on Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi’s poem <em>“Any Lifetime.”</em></p><h3 id=-the-poem-that-sparked-a-vision>🧠 The Poem That Sparked a Vision</h3><blockquote><p><em>“Any lifetime that is spent without seeing the master</em> <em>Is either death in disguise or a deep sleep.</em> <em>The water that pollutes you is poison;</em> <em>The poison that purifies you is water.”</em></p></blockquote><p>These lines are more than poetry — they’re a spiritual cipher. Rumi’s paradoxes challenge our perception of reality, urging us to look beyond appearances and awaken to deeper truths. The “master” here isn’t just a person; it’s the divine presence, the guiding light, the inner compass we often ignore.</p><h3 id=-translating-rumi-into-digital-canvas>🎨 Translating Rumi into Digital Canvas</h3><p>My NFT piece captures this tension between illusion and awakening. I used layered textures to evoke the duality of sleep and death — soft, dreamlike hues clashing with stark, shadowy forms. A central figure floats between two realms: one polluted by distraction, the other purified by surrender.</p><p><a href=https://rarible.com/token/0xc9154424b823b10579895ccbe442d41b9abd96ed:91452768468569359364314199192756546539650632875089436858321335288594884984870>https://rarible.com/token/0xc9154424b823b10579895ccbe442d41b9abd96ed:91452768468569359364314199192756546539650632875089436858321335288594884984870</a></p><p>The water motif plays a key role. In the artwork, it flows in reverse — upward — symbolizing the reversal of worldly logic. Poison becomes water. Water becomes poison. It’s a visual echo of Rumi’s mystical inversion.</p><h3 id=-why-nft>🌐 Why NFT?</h3><p>Rumi’s words have traveled centuries, languages, and continents. By minting this artwork as an NFT, I’m extending that journey into the metaverse — preserving the essence of his message in a format that speaks to today’s seekers. It’s not just a collectible; it’s a digital shrine to awakening.</p><h3 id=-final-reflections>💭 Final Reflections</h3><p>Creating this piece was a spiritual exercise. It reminded me that art — like poetry — can be a portal. A well-crafted NFT isn’t just a token; it’s a talisman. And if even one viewer pauses, reflects, and reconnects with their inner master, then this creation has served its purpose.</p></div></article></div></div></div></body></html>
