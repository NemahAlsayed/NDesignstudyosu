But like many creatives, she faced a challenge—coding was a barrier, and hiring developers was too costly. That’s when she discovered Webydo, a platform built for designers, agencies, and entrepreneurs who want to create pixel-perfect websites without writing a single line of code.
With Webydo’s AI-supported design tools, Layla could focus on storytelling and branding while the platform handled the technical side. Within months, she launched multiple client websites, each tailored to their unique identity. Her small freelance project grew into a full-fledged agency, and her success became proof that technology can empower creativity.
