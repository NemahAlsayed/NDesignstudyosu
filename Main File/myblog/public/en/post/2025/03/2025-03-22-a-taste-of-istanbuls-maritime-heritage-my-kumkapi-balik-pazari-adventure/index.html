    <div class="col order-lg-first"><p>Nestled along the Marmara Sea in the heart of Istanbul, the <strong>Kumkapı Balık Pazarı</strong> (Kumkapı Fish Market) is more than just a market—it’s a living testament to the city’s deep connection to the sea. For centuries, this vibrant neighborhood has been a hub for fishermen, merchants, and food lovers, offering some of the freshest seafood in the world. As someone who loves exploring culinary traditions, I couldn’t resist visiting this iconic market during my time in Istanbul.</p>
<h4 id="a-glimpse-into-history"><strong>A Glimpse into History</strong></h4>
<p>Kumkapı’s story dates back to the Byzantine era, when it was known as <em>Kontoskalion</em>, a bustling port where fishermen and traders gathered. Over the centuries, it evolved into a thriving fishing district under the Ottomans, home to a diverse community of Greeks, Armenians, and Turks. Today, the market remains a symbol of Istanbul’s maritime heritage, where the scent of the sea mingles with the sounds of lively auctions and the chatter of locals haggling over the day’s catch.</p>
<h4 id="my-kumkapı-experience"><strong>My Kumkapı Experience</strong></h4>
<p>During my visit, I was lucky enough to receive a special gift from my friends at the market—a beautiful, fresh fish that reminded me of <strong>jewfish</strong>. After some research and a closer look at its features, I discovered it was an <strong>Orfoz</strong> (grouper), a prized fish in Turkish cuisine known for its firm, white flesh and mild flavor. Inspired by its quality, I decided to turn it into sushi, and the result was nothing short of spectacular. The freshness of the fish truly shone through, making it a meal to remember.</p>
<p>Many common fish sold at the Kumkapı Balık Pazarı include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Levrek</strong> (Sea Bass): A popular fish in Turkish cuisine, often grilled or baked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Çupra</strong> (Sea Bream): Another common fish, similar to sea bass but with a slightly different shape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Palamut</strong> (Bonito): A larger, oily fish often used in grilling or curing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lüfer</strong> (Bluefish): A prized fish in Istanbul, especially in autumn, known for its rich flavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hamsi</strong> (Anchovy): A small, silvery fish, very popular in Black Sea cuisine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>İstavrit</strong> (Horse Mackerel): A smaller fish, often fried or grilled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
