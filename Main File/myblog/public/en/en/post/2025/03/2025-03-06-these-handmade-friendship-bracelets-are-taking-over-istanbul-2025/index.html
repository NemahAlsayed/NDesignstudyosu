A New Rule
It is the rule with drunkards to fall upon each other,
to quarrel, become violent, and make a scene.
The lover is even worse than a drunkard.
I will tell you what love is: to enter a mine of gold.
And what is that gold?
The lover is a king above all kings,
unafraid of death, not at all interested in a golden crown.
The dervish has a pearl concealed under his patched cloak.
Why should he go begging door to door?
Last night that moon came along,
drunk, dropping clothes in the street.
&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; I told my heart, &ldquo;Give the soul a glass of wine.
The moment has come to join the nightingale in the garden,
to taste sugar with the soul-parrot.&rdquo;
I have fallen, with my heart shattered - where else but on your path? And I
broke your bowl, drunk, my idol, so drunk,
don&rsquo;t let me be harmed, take my hand.
A new rule a new law has been born:
break all the glasses and fall toward the glassblower.
Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi
