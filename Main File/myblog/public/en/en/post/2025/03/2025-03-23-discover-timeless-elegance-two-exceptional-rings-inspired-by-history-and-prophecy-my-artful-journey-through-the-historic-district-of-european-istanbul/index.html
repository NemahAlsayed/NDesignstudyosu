<p>I began my tour by visiting the historic Isbank Museum, which was founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic:</p>

<p>These artistic masterpieces are evidence that the Ottoman language was still in use in 1924.</p>
<p>We continue our tour at the Museum of Art and Civilization, where the highest professional techniques in engineering, design, and banking are combined:</p>

<p>Then I continued my tour to the Hagia Sophia Museum and took many wonderful pictures that testify to the Ottoman craftsmanship in calligraphy, poetry and art, such as this exhibition:</p>

<p>The golden inscription tells us about the castle built by Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror during the blessed month of Ramadan in Constantinople. The last line of the plaque reads, &ldquo;Exactly 83 AH.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We will quote the verses from another plaque, along with a translation of their meanings:</p>
<p>Hurşid Şevket Şehriyar&rsquo;ın değiştirilmiş şiirinin başlangıcı</p>
<p>Bani Baniyan Devlet, Kutsal Ev&rsquo;in hizmetkarı</p>
<p>Milal Sirtah&rsquo;ın krallığının varisi olan iki genç adam</p>
<p>Azal Dadar İskender Gulam&rsquo;ın gölgesi süslenmeye devam etti</p>
<p>Dön, Sultan Mustafa sana ihanet etti</p>
<p>Tajdaran Salfadeh Kormade sanki uyuyormuşum gibi</p>
<p>Eliop, Shilshanem&rsquo;in parasını bozdurdu</p>
<p>Aksa Maram&rsquo;da yeni bir ev inşa edeceğim</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bu Diwan Samayoun&rdquo; cümlesi için özür imzalandı</p>
<p>Seramngeh Shaqfna Yuanen ve Jajah Benam</p>
<p>Sultans Selef Asf Nakah&rsquo;a gideceğim</p>
<p>Kazınmış düğmenin çiziminin izlerini tamamen silin</p>
<p>İki genç adam birbirini öptü ve dünya onlara bir erkek gibi baktı</p>
<p>Ben Şayan&rsquo;ım, yemin ederim ki sen ilk iffetli olansın.</p>
<p>Çatınızı yıkan bir rahibin kanında eriyen bir şey</p>
<p>Eski tarz stiller tamamen yenileniyor.</p>
<hr>
<p>The beginning of the modified poem by Khurshid Shaukat Shahriar</p>
<p>I am the builder of the states buidings, servant of the Sacred House</p>
<p>Two young men who were heirs to the kingdom of Milal Sirtah</p>
<p>Azal Dadar Iskander Ghulam&rsquo;s shadow continued to adorn</p>
<p>Return, Sultan Mustafa betrayed you</p>
<p>Tajdaran Salfadeh Kormade as if I were sleeping</p>
<p>Eliop cashed out Shilshanem&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>I will build a new house in the most far wish</p>
<p>Apology signed for the phrase &ldquo;This Diwan Samayoun&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seramngeh Shaqfna Yuanen and Jajah Benam</p>
<p>I will go to Sultans Salaf Asf Nakah</p>
<p>Erase completely the traces of the drawing of the engraved button</p>
<p>Two young men kissed each other and the world looked at them like a man</p>
<p>I am Shayan, I swear that you are the first chaste one.</p>
<p>Something that melts in the blood of a priest who tore down your roof</p>
<p>Old-fashioned styles are being completely revamped.</p>
