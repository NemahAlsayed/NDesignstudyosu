I have no preconceptions. Whatever I see I swallow immediately Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.”</p></blockquote><p>The artwork fuses digital minimalism with symbolic geometry, portraying the mirror not as a passive object, but as an active witness—a “little god, four-cornered.” It challenges viewers to confront their own reflections, stripped of illusion.</p><h3 id=-why-this-nft-resonates-in-the-digital-age>🌐 Why This NFT Resonates in the Digital Age</h3><p>In the age of blockchain and AI, the concept of a mirror takes on new meaning. Just as Plath’s mirror swallows reality without bias, so too does the blockchain record truth without distortion. This NFT invites collectors to own a piece of digital philosophy—an eternal reflection encoded on the blockchain.</p><h3 id=-philosophical-themes-behind-the-art>🧠 Philosophical Themes Behind the Art</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Truth vs. Perception</strong>: The mirror doesn’t interpret—it reflects. This NFT asks: Can we handle truth without narrative?</p></li><li><p><strong>Identity and Ego</strong>: What do we see when we look at ourselves without emotional fog?</p></li><li><p><strong>Divine Witnessing</strong>: The “eye of a little god” suggests omniscient observation. In a decentralized world, who watches whom?</p></li></ul><h3 id=-nft-details-and-purchase-info>🔗 NFT Details and Purchase Info</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Title</strong>: <em>Mirror: The Eye of Truth</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Blockchain</strong>: Ethereum</p></li><li><p><strong>Edition</strong>: 1/1</p></li><li><p><strong>Available on</strong>: Rarible via the <a href=https://og.rarible.com/token/0xc9154424b823b10579895ccbe442d41b9abd96ed:91452768468569359364314199192756546539650632875089436858321335288594884984871>link.</a></p></li></ul></div></article></div></div></div></body></html>
