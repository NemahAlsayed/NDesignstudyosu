A New Rule
It is the rule with drunkards to fall upon each other,
to quarrel, become violent, and make a scene.
The lover is even worse than a drunkard.
I will tell you what love is: to enter a mine of gold.
And what is that gold?
The lover is a king above all kings,"

      <p>This art symbolizes the rich wisdoms of Mavlana Jalal El-din Al-Rumi in a Mystic Sufi Poem as the following:</p>
<p>A New Rule<br>
It is the rule with drunkards to fall upon each other,<br>
to quarrel, become violent, and make a scene.<br>
The lover is even worse than a drunkard.<br>
I will tell you what love is: to enter a mine of gold.<br>
And what is that gold?<br>
The lover is a king above all kings,<br>
unafraid of death, not at all interested in a golden crown.<br>
The dervish has a pearl concealed under his patched cloak.<br>
Why should he go begging door to door?<br>
Last night that moon came along,<br>
drunk, dropping clothes in the street.<br>
&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; I told my heart, &ldquo;Give the soul a glass of wine.<br>
The moment has come to join the nightingale in the garden,<br>
to taste sugar with the soul-parrot.&rdquo;<br>
I have fallen, with my heart shattered -
where else but on your path? And I<br>
broke your bowl, drunk, my idol, so drunk,<br>
don&rsquo;t let me be harmed, take my hand.<br>
A new rule a new law has been born:<br>
break all the glasses and fall toward the glassblower.<br>
<strong>Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi</strong></p>
