      <description>This art symbolizes the rich wisdoms of Mavlana Jalal El-din Al-Rumi in a Mystic Sufi Poem as the following:&#xA;A New Rule&#xA;It is the rule with drunkards to fall upon each other,&#xA;to quarrel, become violent, and make a scene.&#xA;The lover is even worse than a drunkard.&#xA;I will tell you what love is: to enter a mine of gold.&#xA;And what is that gold?&#xA;The lover is a king above all kings,</description>

      <description>Hello to all my new followers of my blog, in this post I will share with you the latest paintings I have been working on for the last couple of months; their theme and story behind them. Enjoy!&#xA;The first one is a circular canvas that represents a clock; I have added mechanical clock pieces on the canvas to make it a wall clock.&#xA;The second and third ones represents the historical town of Jableh in Syria with pronounced elements of the city such as Roman theater and Sufi Mosque arches with white Greek dome architecture style.</description>
