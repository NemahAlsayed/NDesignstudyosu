      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nestled along the Marmara Sea in the heart of Istanbul, the &lt;strong&gt;Kumkapı Balık Pazarı&lt;/strong&gt; (Kumkapı Fish Market) is more than just a market—it’s a living testament to the city’s deep connection to the sea. For centuries, this vibrant neighborhood has been a hub for fishermen, merchants, and food lovers, offering some of the freshest seafood in the world. As someone who loves exploring culinary traditions, I couldn’t resist visiting this iconic market during my time in Istanbul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
